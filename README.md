  # DungeonMood
    A convenient tabletop RPG companion to get your players into it without too much hassle.

    ## What we're trying to build
    DungeonMood is meant to be a simple way of organizing and selecting music, ambient noise tracks, and sound effects from YouTube.

    A basic usage scenario is opening the app, selecting a category of track (music, ambience, SFX), and picking the desired track from that category's options.

    ## Getting Started
    Get the latest version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) and simply clone to your workspace. No further installations needed!

    ### Packages
    Currently, we're not using much of anything. No packages or downloads needed (as of yet)!
