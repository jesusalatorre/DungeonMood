# DungeonMood
A convenient tabletop RPG companion to get your players into it without too much hassle.
  
## What we're trying to build
DungeonMood is meant to be a simple way of organizing and selecting music, ambient noise tracks, and sound effects from YouTube.

A basic usage scenario is opening the app, selecting a category of track (music, ambience, SFX), and picking the desired track from that category's options.

Additionally, we want to quickly view spells with filter/search functionality.

## Getting Started
Get the latest version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) and simply clone to your workspace.
No further installations needed!

### Packages
Currently, we're not using much of anything. No packages or downloads needed (as of yet)!

## TODO
- Design the track selection fragment.
- Design the track addition fragment (the Floating Action Button should handle additions depending on context)

- Design the spell selection fragment.

- Design the homebrew management fragment.
- Design the selection addition fragment (the Floating Action Button should handle additions only once a category is selected)
